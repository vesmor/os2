# Concurrent Hash Table Group 10

## Concurrent Hash Table

To run type make in the terminal containing the files, then ./chash to execute the program.

This program was written on Linux and works 100% of the time there, on Mac we were unable to make the results consistent, and we did not 
test on Windows.

Use Of AI: We did use Chatgpt to help us with the programming. We mainly used the AI for things that we didnt remember how to do for example,
We used AI in the implementation of the Search, Insert, and Delete functions in hashdb.c, it was able to easily provide us with working
functions with a few minor tweaks. We also prompted ChagtGpt to help with the chash.c file to help us start with fileoutput and fileinput and changed
it to fit our needs throughout the program.

In terms of prompting we mainly just inputed the instructions provided on Webcourses, when it didnt provide us with what we wanted we clarified
further by giving it the structures you provided to us and asking it to implement them. And when all else failed we simply scrapped it and wrote
it ourselves, or used the chatgpt code as a base and modified it ourselves.
